<h1>Brightest</h1>

There are three or four<br>
seconds between the<br>
clicks of broken crankset<br>
on the latest nights laced<br>
with adjacent luminosities<br>
and surreptitious glances<br>
and back of hand touch.<br>
<br>
Late lake lit low on warm<br>
weekend afternoons with<br>
goosebump breeze and<br>
words on platforms and<br>
palms that touch hips<br>
and waists and fingers<br>
traversing the length<br>
of narrowing distance.<br>
<br>
Notice the breathing and<br>
furrowed brows, a focus<br>
on sandcastles and houses<br>
made of cards, the biggest<br>
problems are no more easily<br>
solved by forgetting arched<br>
backs, sharp breaths, toes<br>
tingling, contented collapse.<br>
<br>
Some sunshine mornings<br>
yield just the right few<br>
moments when arms and<br>
legs entangle and you<br>
bring your lips to mine.<br>
