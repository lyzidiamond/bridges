<h1>Oh, pines</h1>

Long winds are coming through<br>
the building, they blow via taps<br>
left on, they spew hot air.<br>
<br>
Circle games, let's just move in<br>
and stack the cardboard tubes<br>
in an intelligent fashion,<br>
let's pull it together for<br>
breaking ice and watering down.<br>
<br>
Power up and out of the office<br>
and into the wires of emergency<br>
rock, the tables, the walls, the<br>
bookcases taut and tensionless<br>
and keeping secrets of the room,<br>
imprisoned by gravity and friction.<br>
