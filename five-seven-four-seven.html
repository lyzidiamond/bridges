<h1>Five Seven Four Seven</h1>

He was long-winded<br>
and going on about<br>
physics, about gravity<br>
and the processes with<br>
which it associates,<br>
about how you can<br>
blow lightly on a<br>
precariously assembled<br>
house of cards to see<br>
it fall over but if you<br>
remove one of the great<br>
mortared stones from<br>
the base of one of the<br>
great mortared pyramids<br>
the structure stands tall<br>
and sturdy, a forever<br>
remnant of one great<br>
injustice and remarkable<br>
innovation.<br>
<br>
In the dusty garage that<br>
day his glasses covered<br>
in gray soot and greased<br>
fingerprints on side of<br>
face and shoes with caked<br>
mud from the recent rain<br>
that quickly turned to<br>
cerulean sky as the clouds<br>
were whisked by so quickly<br>
it looked like they were<br>
being pulled by some great<br>
and holy wind, beckoned<br>
to festoon someone's poorly<br>
timed outdoor wedding and<br>
force crepe paper flowers<br>
to stick to stucco walls like<br>
wheat paste.<br>
<br>
You think you need to<br>
talk to a person when<br>
you have a problem, <br>
but those automated<br>
systems were created<br>
in the images of people<br>
who were created in<br>
the images of other<br>
people who were<br>
created in the image<br>
of God or some other<br>
restless celestial being,<br>
perhaps a dying star<br>
or an asteroid hurtling<br>
and on a trajectory to<br>
startle a species primitive<br>
and struggling to survive.<br>
<br>
The vast mathematical<br>
implications that determine<br>
the universe are sometimes<br>
a bit too much for dinner<br>
conversation, so our chats<br>
turn quickly to local sports<br>
teams and the evening news.<br>
