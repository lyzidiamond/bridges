<h1>I'm actually blind</h1>

Desperate avoidance of pronouns, articles<br>
and questioning favorability of parts of speech<br>
in desperate attempts to compartmentalize neurosis<br>
like you're embarrassed and I'm foolish<br>
swimming in this sweater<br>
that was never mine anyway<br>
although in dreams it was bequeathed<br>
and I hold tight to that reality<br>
<br>
How can a forest be on fire<br>
while it's raining?<br>
How can you put aside your<br>
shiny weapons and arch voice to smooth sounds<br>
lyrics that speak nascent truths<br>
excuse me, sir, if I ask quietly<br>
will you provide some affirmation<br>
<br>
Getting to me, getting me<br>
it moves slow, it shouts<br>
I never forget my luck, my two-step<br>
I stay patient, hungry<br>
I built a bunk bed in this speaker<br>
are you planning to stay a while?<br>
<br>
I'll touch your caveat if you touch mine<br>
I'll sing your songs if you lie still<br>
