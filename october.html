<h1>October</h1>

Snow white cat on streetcorner sits<br>
reflecting blinking bike light<br>
into the road with no streetlamps<br>
on a night full of stars.<br>
<br>
Every song that feels<br>
like it's written just for you is another<br>
reminder that your feelings are<br>
more commonly experienced<br>
than you might think.<br>
<br>
Breezy autumn evening rides<br>
for time travel and other such activities<br>
make music from wind in leaves<br>
and weave from side to side.<br>
<br>
I am off to build a house<br>
and lay down bricks one<br>
at a time, one at a time,<br>
to live in for a short while<br>
and then to leave sitting, alone,<br>
until long abandoned, we<br>
return for exploration.<br>
