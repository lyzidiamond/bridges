<h1>Starboard</h1>

All you've got is dead<br>
ends and some cilantro<br>
and maybe a few basil<br>
leaves and a book of<br>
stamps and your feet in<br>
the sand and the rain<br>
beaded in your hair.<br>
<br>
What is to be done with<br>
foggy film and sixteenth<br>
notes, how am I supposed<br>
to build a bridge alone?<br>
I can't even see the next<br>
pier, I don't know how<br>
you expect me to reach it.<br>
<br>
In testing new environments<br>
and procedures you grab<br>
the cast iron skillet and<br>
throw it at the wall<br>
to see what sticks.<br>
<br>
With sparkles and bells on<br>
I respond with a tremor<br>
like a California earthquake.<br>
