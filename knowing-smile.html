<h1>Knowing Smile</h1>

The most sinister sounds exist in your head<br>
or they are in the walls too, scratching and<br>
clawing and gnashing gnarled teeth to<br>
intimidate, initiate conversation. I, like the<br>
elephant man, can't get people to look at me.<br>
<br>
Crawling in the walls, crawling in the walls.<br>
<br>
Body noises, bodies making noise all on their<br>
own, no contact necessary, no touches, none<br>
small swift sweet brush of fingertips on freshly<br>
shaved legs, these noises follow marbles down<br>
tubes of recent cell growth and death and the<br>
burnt cilia from one or two nights up too late.<br>
<br>
Who wouldn't want the danger? Who wouldn't<br>
be seduced by the threat of extinction, the on<br>
and on challenges of basic survival? I don't know<br>
that I want to know the people who would lie<br>
down during the apocalypse to be taken up to<br>
heaven or who hang on to thoughts of angels<br>
in clouds out of fear. Stop apologizing. Just stop.<br>
<br>
Move slow through tall grass on hands and knees.<br>
<br>
With one light slow breath I can pass pathogens<br>
to unsuspecting commuters on the 7:05 train<br>
who will pass by hundreds of people in their day,<br>
breathing heavy from flights of stairs and some<br>
pollution in the air and some emotional turmoil<br>
that will likely resolve itself right before collapse.<br>
<br>
Understanding imminent destruction has a<br>
strange power reminiscent of floodlights<br>
coating a thousand heavy construction sites<br>
covered in some damp damn dirty snow.<br>
