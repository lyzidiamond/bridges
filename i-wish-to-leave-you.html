<h1>I wish to leave you with this &mdash;</h1>

I wish to leave you with this&mdash;<br>
the passionate preamble of a post-pubescent<br>
rabble-rouser with red ringlet<br>
curls, cascades of casual<br>
looks looming through the locks<br>
that hide her harrowed hands<br>
gripping the sides of her face.<br>
<br>
"You, young lover<br>
you, angel in the dark stage<br>
you, wanting woman<br>
waiting while we wash<br>
our hands of this mess<br>
of living breathing beauty.<br>
You are me<br>
and I am falling asleep at the wheel."<br>
<br>
She sheds, shines<br>
careless crimson<br>
over the outside door,<br>
twisting the tight tendons<br>
of her frustrated neck,<br>
spine spinning, swindling,<br>
trying to trick me into saying,<br>
"I will, I do."<br>
I don't. I wont.<br>
<br>
Her hand holding hands<br>
lays latent in loud laughs<br>
dies in the demon drunk night.<br>
