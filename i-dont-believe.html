<h1>I don't believe</h1>

I don't believe<br>
I don't believe in adding<br>
round shapes of varying<br>
diameter I don't believe<br>
in groupings of similar<br>
objects for aesthetic<br>
pleasure I don't believe<br>
in collection for sake of<br>
comfort or to appease<br>
some wealthy donor<br>
I don't believe in some<br>
mass of tangled string<br>
that defines the universe<br>
I don't believe in museum<br>
display signs that ask<br>
you to not touch I don't<br>
believe in the science of<br>
star symbols I don't believe<br>
in your grasp as bait or<br>
as appeasement or as a<br>
subtle reminder that I am<br>
alive I don't believe in<br>
my eyes in the mirror as<br>
you exit the room, quietly<br>
