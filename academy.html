<h1>Academy</h1>

On a dewy moonlit front stoop in<br>
September the hiss of extinguishing<br>
embers in an ashtray drowns out<br>
crickets (in the city? Why?) and<br>
truck horns from the highway<br>
while the neighbors drink cheap<br>
domestic beer and sing out loud<br>
to radio hits, sounds penetrating,<br>
muffled, through heavy doors.<br>
<br>
Stretch arms up with back cracks<br>
side to side, bending forward and<br>
considering the pile of paperwork<br>
shoved to the side of the desk, next<br>
to a pot full of water that only<br>
occasionally spills, only when the<br>
chair pushes against the side of the<br>
smooth black surface, only when<br>
there's been one too many and the<br>
Saturdays are full of drizzly skies<br>
and shouting at televisions as men<br>
jump and yell and throw themselves<br>
into each other such that organizing<br>
space is much less than a priority.<br>
<br>
There is a spot on the front lawn<br>
where grass is reluctant to grow<br>
that on the Fourth of July held a<br>
folding table with red plastic cups<br>
and awkward side glances to try<br>
to obscure the uncomfortable meets<br>
and greets and questions asked<br>
with eyes and loud patriotism<br>
bouncing off the street still warm<br>
from the afternoon sunshine.<br>
<br>
The dust of front window and<br>
squeaky red door pulls additions<br>
when stomping feet on soggy<br>
doormat and turns quickly to<br>
mud on the concrete step that<br>
is home to insecurities and<br>
broken promises that fall from<br>
mouths well trained and bike<br>
accidents of a karmic nature.<br>
<br>
Squint and smile into the dark<br>
with toothy grin that mocks<br>
and muses and beats down on<br>
insecure eyes spread wide with<br>
admiration seeking your<br>
go-ahead, the few moments of<br>
your life when you drop your<br>
shoulders and admit that<br>
someone else has a point.<br>
<br>
Touching hand to doorknob, a<br>
waver. Hand reaches into pocket<br>
and pulls out another. Lighter<br>
flicks into shadows lit by a<br>
moon too bright. You sit back<br>
down and listen to the night.<br>
