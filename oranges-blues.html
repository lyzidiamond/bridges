<h1>Oranges, Blues, Yellowish Hues</h1>

Northwest autumn turns to winter<br>
Damp leaves, slipping on uneven ground.<br>
<br>
That is, of course, the rain.<br>
<br>
Under this criticism<br>
the red orange yellows<br>
behind the backdrop of electric<br>
blue,<br>
wet eyes, wet face, wet hair<br>
and a suspicious swagger<br>
over boots and coats and windbreakers.<br>
<br>
The winter comes,<br>
defeat of the sun<br>
for a charcoal blanket<br>
and a slip fall break<br>
of twigs caught in the spokes.<br>
