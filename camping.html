<h1>Camping</h1>

I've never thought less of you<br>
than in begging moment, flipped<br>
on smooth river rocks, arms wide<br>
on expanded hips, smile<br>
fake and expectant.<br>
<br>
You paddle kayaks in<br>
awkward plaids and throwaway<br>
sweaters, grinning sweetly<br>
at dimples and polished toenails<br>
and forgetting my name<br>
while I repeat yours in echo.<br>
<br>
On tall bicycle, you look down<br>
at tear-strewn carpet, at<br>
lingering rain, and you lean<br>
to one side, precarious balance<br>
while the sun peeks through the blinds.<br>
