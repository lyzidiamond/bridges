Sweat in shade sweat, shade<br>
and speak an octave higher to four-legged foes<br>
biting your knees and knocking you down<br>
singing in iambs, awaiting the slaughter<br>
and dancing, always dancing<br>
amid triangles on triangles of smoke<br>
<br>
Waterfalls cascade, not topple<br>
and human pyramids stay sick and envy<br>
consumes the crowd like a virus<br>
so they bark and sweep like clean linens on whipping posts<br>
<br>
Drink faster, leave town<br>
before you encounter sticky blue fingers<br>
before they stain your blouse and cheeks<br>
before they make you grade papers and sing hymns<br>
before curiosity kills your wonder<br>
and your joints buckle and crack<br>
with loud snaps and ringing bells<br>
<br>
I don't think you understand the geography<br>
you keep running in circles in my head<br>
while I keep pushing you toward the door<br>
