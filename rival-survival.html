<h1>Rival, survival</h1>

Glowing rooftops and alligator skin<br>
washed up on green sand beaches<br>
camouflaged, hiding shifty eyes<br>
except irises purple and pupils expanding<br>
what does distortion look like<br>
reverberating through salty waves<br>
<br>
Light flashes between the fifth<br>
and minor four like a polaroid<br>
but you probably don't remember<br>
that kind of instant gratification<br>
in a modern world where tangible<br>
means antiquated and to make<br>
means a veritable lifetime<br>
<br>
Buck up, kid<br>
the world is full of shortcuts<br>
that introduce dense foliage<br>
and exotic invasive species<br>
and first dances on wedding days<br>
and bare feet scuffed and scraped<br>
racking up years of tear<br>
and callouses leathery and intimidating<br>
<br>
When the rain disintegrates your cover<br>
and your muscles ache and strain<br>
touch your toes and listen<br>
to birds singing in the wind<br>
