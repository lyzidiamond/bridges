<h1>Upstate</h1>

Six pregnant cigarettes later<br>
a mint julep poured and tasted<br>
fingers licked while lips drunk sting<br>
and sweat beads and rolls on upper lip.<br>
<br>
A lean on outdoor table with<br>
feet raised on outdoor chair and<br>
grass greener than the impressionists<br>
while the sevens and eights dance<br>
with awkward hair and chocolate stains<br>
a look from picture window<br>
and ribeye steak and butter in the pan.<br>
<br>
Fish and gills in the air and salt<br>
drops on tiny blue eyeballs<br>
so squints make their way gracefully<br>
into every last family portrait.<br>
