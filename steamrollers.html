<h1>Steamrollers</h1>

I am the tiny wine glass<br>
underneath a crisp white cloth<br>
crushed under the wide, leathered<br>
foot of groom under chuppah in a tall<br>
synagogue in colored leaf autumn<br>
in a wedding I'll never have<br>
on a street I'll never see.<br>
<br>
I am the dinner plate<br>
being thrown from the edge<br>
of a blue, chipped paint dumpster<br>
on the side of a sparkling parking lot<br>
slick after persistent winter drizzle<br>
that spits angrily from the sky<br>
in a stack of other kitchen<br>
items to be smashed<br>
against pavement.<br>
<br>
I am wrist bones of<br>
the minuscule, important variety<br>
in the moment a twig is caught in spokes<br>
and thrown from the bicycle, you make impact<br>
with the brick wall adjacent to the alley<br>
and hear some small cracks<br>
and are unable to lift your<br>
fingers or right hand,<br>
or twist to pull<br>
yourself up.<br>
<br>
I am the double-paned<br>
window of a basement apartment<br>
in the summer when hoodlums and homeless<br>
kick glass for fun and seek to scare<br>
innocent movie-watchers as<br>
fireworks pierce and light<br>
the third of July sky.<br>
<br>
I am a sad little girl<br>
with sad little eyes that look<br>
out to the future and see something<br>
moving in the distance, a pair of two young<br>
people holding hands, walking on an<br>
Oregon beach in foggy mist,<br>
that blink and realize that<br>
mirages are cruel, and<br>
have no remorse.<br>
<br>
I don't remember the strength I earned<br>
though I hear in time, it's relearned.<br>
