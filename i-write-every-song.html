<h1>I write every song for you</h1>

With heavy breath, I bring<br>
pen to page and finger to string<br>
and hold left hand over right, to steady<br>
my shaking wrist as I tremble,<br>
the echo of your voice resonating<br>
permeating<br>
bouncing off every sinewy fiber,<br>
ankles and hips and lungs and heart<br>
beating for you.<br>
<br>
I try to write of other things&mdash;<br>
of clouds and car crashes and<br>
mysterious men in dark suits with trombone cases and silencers,<br>
or big whaling ships off the coast of Japan,<br>
cold lights singing through marine mist&mdash;<br>
but the trains of thought all lead to your<br>
"I love you,"<br>
to your<br>
"I want you,"<br>
to your<br>
"I'm all yours."<br>
<br>
The lyrical cadence is tired,<br>
reminiscent of the classics and<br>
traversing paths well-traveled.<br>
The major keys with clean sound&mdash;<br>
no reverb, no filter, no distortion&mdash;<br>
are boring and basic,<br>
and the vocal sickly sweet<br>
and the floor toms empty<br>
and the ride cymbal whispering<br>
shhhhhhhh<br>
over a cavalcade of harmonics<br>
in a complete circle of fifths.<br>
<br>
You are the fairy tale,<br>
the "once upon a time"<br>
and the "happily ever after"<br>
that feel fabricated passing through the lips of others,<br>
but more lucid than taste and smell when<br>
falling through yours<br>
mine<br>
ours<br>
pressed<br>
pushed<br>
touch<br>
close.<br>
<br>
It all devolves<br>
into tangled limbs<br>
bright colors<br>
and whispered, made up words.<br>
The ones that exist simply won't do.<br>
<br>
I write every song<br>
every single goddamned song<br>
for you.<br>
