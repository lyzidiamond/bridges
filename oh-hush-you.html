<h1>Oh Hush, You</h1>

Yellow plums with sweet<br>
flesh and sour skin<br>
bleed down chins and smell<br>
of summer swims and sneezes.<br>
<br>
Once upon a time, a girl.<br>
<br>
The grass seed and tree pollen<br>
and dust and pet dander<br>
and prickly pinecones and banjo strings<br>
and the transition between analog and synthetic,<br>
between automatic and didactic.<br>
<br>
Ears perk like dogs at impossible pitches<br>
upon a hidden harmony, missed melodic movement<br>
she stops mid-sentence to hear, listen not hear, listen<br>
for the sounds buried under sounds<br>
and other sounds<br>
and tape distortion<br>
and old speakers<br>
and ambient noise<br>
and the head voices<br>
and the wind in the leaves.<br>
<br>
Candle flames hiss on extinguishing breaths<br>
sighing promises for future dividends<br>
dancing in circles on hardwood floors<br>
skirt breezes<br>
hip shakes until it's too much<br>
floor shakes until it's all fallen<br>
borrowing thumbtacks and bringing it all<br>
bringing it all down.<br>
<br>
Far in the distance I can hear the bells tolling, ringing not tolling, ringing<br>
in time with the sunrise blinking, winking<br>
sharing a knowing promise for a better day tomorrow,<br>
today not tomorrow, today.<br>
