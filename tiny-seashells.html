<h1>Tiny Seashells</h1>

Tiny seashells<br>
Island can't stop sliding<br>
even when dull pencils<br>
stuck in sand push back<br>
strong, even when your<br>
toes are curling inward<br>
and holding on tight<br>
<br>
The sunburn highway is<br>
crowded today and we're<br>
stuck in traffic, caught<br>
behind a particularly<br>
thick cloud, compounding<br>
beach  breezes and midday<br>
shivering beneath towels<br>
<br>
With sweaty hands clapping<br>
beat and fast punches, the<br>
overnight foliage blooms<br>
and dies, laughing hard<br>
in the bright room with no doors<br>
