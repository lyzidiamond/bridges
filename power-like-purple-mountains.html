<h1>Power Like Purple Mountains</h1>

Who even are you anymore?<br>
Hiding under small orange<br>
bottles are letters from a former<br>
life, a former name and address<br>
in former envelopes and former<br>
handwriting, former pen<br>
smudges and former doodles<br>
on the folds. Save yourself.<br>
Save yourself first.<br>
<br>
Swipe, snap, flint on stone<br>
to make sparks that make<br>
flame that make fires that<br>
make light and heat and<br>
allow drawing of deeper<br>
features than really exist<br>
with shadows moving in<br>
erratic fashions, swinging<br>
back and forth between<br>
the you that was farther<br>
from death and the you<br>
that is much, much closer.<br>
<br>
Giving is hard. Taking<br>
is the easiest thing you<br>
can do so long as you<br>
can run fast enough to<br>
escape the guilt that is<br>
falling on you like trees<br>
in a northwestern forest<br>
with gravel crunching<br>
sound of logging trucks<br>
not too distant grinding<br>
their way up small roads<br>
and wind blowing through<br>
trees that are deceptively<br>
deciduous and shaking.<br>
<br>
I'm judging you for<br>
just about everything.<br>
I am hard like feverish<br>
breaths in a sweaty<br>
freezing bedroom that<br>
belonged to someone<br>
else who bled in all the<br>
corners and licked all<br>
the walls and is reaching<br>
out from the breathless<br>
past to steal yours too.<br>
<br>
It's just you and me<br>
here, you can tell me<br>
anything, I promise I<br>
will hold all your secrets<br>
like they're crystal glasses<br>
that belonged to your<br>
grandmother's grandmother<br>
and made their way here<br>
smuggled in a suitcase<br>
with pulled out gold<br>
teeth and brown plaid<br>
blankets folded neatly<br>
such that none of the<br>
corners stuck out the side.<br>
<br>
Sneakers sinking<br>
into mossy muddy<br>
backyard ground,<br>
you extend arms<br>
up and grab the<br>
lowest branch of<br>
the tallest tree and<br>
pull yourself up<br>
to sit atop and look<br>
down at all the people,<br>
holding your fingers to<br>
your eye and squishing<br>
their heads between.<br>
