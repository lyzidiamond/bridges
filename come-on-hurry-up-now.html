<h1>come on hurry up now it's time</h1>

Unfit to wait forever I am<br>
impatient I am noticing fluorescent<br>
light flicker while you waffle and<br>
waver I am sitting on the front steps<br>
pushing the doorbell on threes and fours<br>
if we don't leave now we'll miss the bus<br>
come on hurry up now it's time<br>
<br>
Yell through sore throat I hurt heard you<br>
I have done and undone the buckle<br>
on this bag I am waiting are you going<br>
to strangle me are you going to straggle<br>
will we miss this flight while you focus<br>
neatly on the folds of your skin<br>
come on hurry up now it's time<br>
<br>
Restless you are restless I can hear<br>
your foot tapping on the hard wood<br>
and fingers on the tile I can see<br>
where you are wanting to go why won't you<br>
talk to me while I lay silent on the carpet<br>
come on hurry up now it's time<br>
<br>
I should go I should just get up and<br>
go and let you linger and concerning<br>
the electrical bill well once you fix<br>
that bulb we can talk but right now<br>
I need out of here I need to know<br>
if you're going to follow me down<br>
<br>
come on hurry up now it's time<br>
