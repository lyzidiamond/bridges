<h1>Morning Meal</h1>


Watching milk pour into little<br>
ziploc bags with bananas and<br>
Cheerios and fights over which<br>
fruit better invokes the feeling<br>
of sunrise, of home and<br>
morning eye crust and blown<br>
curtains in summer breeze.<br>
<br>
Strawberries don't stain dresses<br>
as much as blackberries from<br>
a friend's farm in upstate<br>
New York or Eastern Washington<br>
or some ranch in coastal Venezuela<br>
with coffee and sugar smells<br>
stuck on sticky skin and licking<br>
juice from sweet fingertips<br>
right before it starts to rain.<br>
<br>
When February sun peeks<br>
through cumulus clouds after<br>
a five-day downpour, you turn<br>
your face to mine and proclaim<br>
that the world may be beautiful and youthful, after all.<br>
