<h1>I wish to</h1>

I wish to be wealthy in time<br>
to hoard it in boxes and jars<br>
that are blue and caked in<br>
fine powder, to keep seconds<br>
in a piggy bank that is cracked<br>
open every year on my birthday,<br>
when I am excited to learn that<br>
a year of saving yielded more<br>
than just one or two minutes.<br>
<br>
I wish to surf my history<br>
to return to the moments when<br>
it was possible to ride my<br>
bicycle across town in 15 minutes,<br>
when I would laugh at serious<br>
notions and pass off my days<br>
shielded from the rain in a<br>
twisted building with wooden<br>
chairs and faded couches.<br>
<br>
I wish to lay down across days<br>
stretching my arms up across<br>
the calendar, reclaiming the<br>
moments I spent staring at the<br>
wall, falling into songs sung<br>
just for me, wondering if I would<br>
ever make it out alive, wondering<br>
if the purple would stain the sheets.<br>
<br>
I wish to return to a particular<br>
hour that yielded the sharpest<br>
spike in self-discovery, when I<br>
laid with you and listened to<br>
those songs I had heard over and<br>
over so many times and watched<br>
before my eyes them take on<br>
new meaning, watched them<br>
change the way it looked outside<br>
my window and where my<br>
reflection used to seem dull and<br>
glassy I saw a glow reminiscent<br>
of candle wax and silver beads<br>
and box stools.<br>
