<h1>Tradition</h1>

What time is it?<br>
We should be fine,<br>
on time in Nashville.<br>
Muted colors and eyes<br>
heavy, wander in<br>
blind monotone, sing<br>
to waving adolescents.<br>
<br>
The light turns orange<br>
with age before brightening<br>
morning sky, the flood<br>
on the tarmac transitions<br>
to scattered blue as seconds<br>
creep closer to the dawn.<br>
<br>
Arched window voice in<br>
rolling fields with fences<br>
cry out like grass seed sneezes<br>
from rainy Octobers and Julys.<br>
