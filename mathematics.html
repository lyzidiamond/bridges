<h1>Mathematics</h1>

On a wrist ticks seconds<br>
like three quarter stops between<br>
heartbeats and chests rising and falling<br>
in cut time and 11/8<br>
meeting every 22 measures as<br>
the record ends and the arm<br>
raises and moves from right<br>
side graze to left shoulder<br>
while backs of hands meet<br>
split ends and the end of dust crackles<br>
over tall speakers.<br>
<br>
Feeling bones and sad<br>
smiles and long sighs and eyes<br>
wide and falling and glances of<br>
concern and fear and hyper-vigilant self-<br>
awareness that can feel too structured<br>
and square until fingertips meet<br>
curves and you remember that<br>
the night can contain certain elements<br> 
of a smooth and shapely nature.<br>
<br>
You touch toes and hold on tighter.<br>
