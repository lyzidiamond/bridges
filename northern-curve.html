<h1>Northern Curve</h1>

In the morning, rays and grays<br>
peek through dark curtains and<br>
I can hear the rain dance on<br>
double pane I can hear some breath<br>
measured and wanting I can hear<br>
a foreign tongue and blue-eyed laugh<br>
and fingers tracing cartography on<br>
fading maps of Western Europe.<br>
<br>
I like to hold the secrets of your past<br>
close against my chest like bouquets<br>
of dried flowers, crumbling in time<br>
and dotted with sweat from<br>
fever dreams, I watch you<br>
sick and typing and moving<br>
away from where I stand fast<br>
and with increasing frequency.<br>
<br>
It's only in magic that we<br>
ride bikes, wet leaves caught<br>
under fenders along a river<br>
side by side in shadows<br>
of a lifting bridge.<br>
