<h1>My girl is the softest planet</h1>

My girl is the softest planet<br>
and I am unsure, but she says<br>
the gaseous rings are clinging<br>
tight to her knuckles and it is<br>
after midnight when she finally<br>
exhales and the room turns pink<br>
and bright with starlight<br>
<br>
On absent Tuesdays, and only those<br>
of even number, we sit on docks<br>
and watch the city float by<br>
on cumulonimbus and pouring<br>
and hail tie-dying the whites on our shirts<br>
and blue eyes gray in stony reflection<br>
<br>
Purple tangle watches, thorny stems<br>
on a chase through the downtown streets<br>
after falling for and off of you<br>
under creaks of a lifting bridge<br>
