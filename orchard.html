I want all the songs that give you goosebumps<br>
to live on one single piece of wax, a low rumble<br>
that spans acres, that stretches for miles in each<br>
direction, that raises the skin of all who can see<br>
and feel its grooves and pushes each of us to swim<br>
in sound.<br>
<br>
I want you to find all of the noises that pull you<br>
and hold them in your heart as tightly as you gripped<br>
the note I passed you in class complaining about<br>
our professor's tenuous grasp of English grammar, the<br>
ink sweating through the notebook paper and staining<br>
your fingertips. Hold these noises in your heart and allow<br>
the tones to imprint themselves inside your chest, next to<br>
all your other organs.<br>
<br>
I want you to sprawl yourself inside of all of this<br>
calamitous cacophony such that you don't know<br>
where your breath begins or if it's part of the melody<br>
or the harmony or another part entirely that you've<br>
never experienced or thought possible, like alto clef or<br>
diminuendo or a vibration in your stomach that<br>
snaps you back to exactly where you are, exactly<br>
where you are.<br>
<br>
I want you inside of all of the waves, inside all<br>
of the resonating structures, like unreinforced<br>
masonry and rebar after a larger earthquake<br>
than any of us anticipated, like a tuning fork<br>
standing tall in the middle of the city, like a<br>
memory you can't get out of your head, like a<br>
cold beachfront property sitting high atop<br>
eroding ground.<br>
<br>
I want you to reach over to the stereo and<br>
pause before lowering the volume, thinking of<br>
my face listening and falling in love with the<br>
crashing of instruments and electronic tones<br>
and I want you to know that when I was with<br>
you I was inside of all of it, feeling the rough<br>
edges and all the parts of it and dulling the pain<br>
from your sharp angles jutting out in my direction<br>
and I want you to put yourself in my head and think<br>
what it would be like to have to avoid eye daggers and<br>
unspoken thoughts.<br>
<br>
I want you to fall inside of the music and allow<br>
yourself to be pierced by its high treble and<br>
shoved by its low bass and I want you to think of me<br>
and how all the sounds are mine and how you will<br>
never catch me sharing my records with you again<br>
and how the needle pokes your fingertips when you<br>
try to drop it and how that feels, bleeding on the<br>
vinyl, alone.<br>
