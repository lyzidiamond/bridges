<h1>The most that you can offer</h1>

Did you ever ask<br>
how long it takes to write<br>
you out of every verse<br>
and all the lines and pages<br>
crumpled in the wastebin<br>
and beads in your hair<br>
and lips drawn like mannequins<br>
and some unsavory sounds<br>
muffled and escaping under the door<br>
<br>
Tap tap slap with accent<br>
and headache and eyeroll<br>
while matching shirts stain<br>
in the same exact places<br>
and the low powerhouse hum<br>
hovers somewhere between C and D flat<br>
while beachy melody traipses<br>
over mutual bored expressions<br>
<br>
Everything is borrowed, have you ever<br>
built anything with your hands?<br>
Why so soft and exhausted,<br>
you pussy? Why don't you stand and fight back?<br>
<br>
Unknown monsters disappear<br>
into shadows and thick smoke<br>
leaving a trail of tired descriptors<br>
and false intention<br>
