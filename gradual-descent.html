<h1>Gradual descent</h1>

Under the auspices of healing<br>
we whisper incantations in the dark<br>
warm breath in cold air lit by moonlight<br>
employing physics and drawing circles<br>
doing everything we can to hang on<br>
<br>
Caught in the pressure, twig snaps<br>
tambourine shakes on twos and fours<br>
I am bouncing on the balls of my feet<br>
muscles tense, coiled, and ready<br>
<br>
I refuse to fight your ghost<br>
or engage in debate with any demons<br>
I will let the wave reach over my head<br>
and crash down behind me<br>
I will float in your salty embrace<br>
under skies gray and foreboding<br>
