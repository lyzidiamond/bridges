<h1>Despicable</h1>

Think about it and you'll realize<br>
that there is no better color than wine-stained teeth<br>
on high school students' prom nights<br>
and muffled giggles from the girls<br>
bathroom in the banquet hall of some <br>
community center or middle school <br>
gymnasium or overgrown grange hall<br>
tell the secrets of the universe<br>
under rushing water and dripping mascara<br>
and notes scrawled in the grout with hearts<br>
and other embellishment<br>
<br>
Damp palms on shoulders and waists<br>
with batting lashes and shy smiles and<br>
stomachs growling from a skipped dinner<br>
toes turned outward, awkward<br>
when the slow song moves to charging beat<br>
and hands flex like an accidental graze on the hot stove<br>
a hip shake to assuage and seem like they meant it all along<br>
that moment guides the other movements<br>
and other movements<br>
<br>
Driving up the hills and back down into the canyon<br>
up the fire trail and to the right, no, the second right<br>
crap, you passed it, turn around<br>
watch the glitter lights of neighborhoods and boats<br>
know there really are no better photographs<br>
than those from disposable cameras that are blurred and laughing<br>
developed weeks later and comingled with images of her dog<br>
and your mom<br>
and the backyard with candles blown out<br>
