<h1>Out in graves</h1>

Instant chapped lip moving from<br>
icicle breath to sweaty sigh in this<br>
storm of memory this blizzard<br>
of foreign hope, not sure of the<br>
goal but damn sure of the end.<br>
<br>
Old wood frames where you<br>
make sure to stand when the<br>
ground starts shaking, on the<br>
other side of the room, knees<br>
knocking on hard floor and<br>
trembling fingers gripping<br>
wet splinters, deep cuts.<br>
<br>
There's a collective noise,<br>
a chorus of claws and some<br>
babbling basil-soaked bird<br>
is hobbling across the house,<br>
caked in bloody muddy sap.<br>
<br>
I'm just organizing myself,<br>
don't you pay any mind.<br>
