<h1>Hanging in the orchid room</h1>

Hanging in the orchid room<br>
some smoke from someone's<br>
clover leaf traffic jam<br>
and disappearing words in<br>
highlighter yellow scream<br>
out from behind your eyelids<br>
thinking, a memory, past fear<br>
<br>
I don't know what to tell you<br>
except that she's gone<br>
and you've been sitting in<br>
the same spot for three or four<br>
hours and the ceiling is<br>
falling around you<br>
<br>
She only sleeps in specific<br>
increments and watches<br>
her feet, dangling off the side<br>
of the tallest building she<br>
can find, sweat dripping<br>
through the marine layer below.<br>
