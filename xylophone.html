<h1>Xylophone</h1>

Like a footnote on a first date<br>
phone call and voices low<br>
and wavering, a quip quick<br>
and quiet, monotone, sharp.<br>
<br>
Free foundations firm<br>
and faltering, a game<br>
for half a decade second to<br>
determine if the felt fear<br>
is fabricated or fiercely<br>
solid, a rock in a strong stream.<br>
<br>
Eyelid shapes appear in clouds<br>
and up and up the plastic<br>
primary colors, the crisp white<br>
sheets, the springtime rain.<br>
<br>
Cream steam in mugs with<br>
photos of pets and birthdays<br>
and cracks in the rim, cracks<br>
in the handle, hanging wearing.<br>
<br>
Calloused fingers fondle the memories<br>
and lose track of conversation.<br>
